### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): Roughly 6 hours.
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): Roughly 5 hours.
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>I found it interesting. It was slightly repititve in the initial implementations because we had already worked on matrix functions in assembly, however, speeding up the functions in order to pass performance added spice.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>OpenMP and SIMD. I am aware that this was covered in lab but I haven't submitted a lab in about 2 months, so...</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>My work ethic. Actually permadoomed. I could have finished this days ago, but I struggle so much mentally for the simplest of tasks.</b>
